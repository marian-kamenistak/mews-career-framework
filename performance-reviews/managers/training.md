# Training

Having people aligned on expectations from each role up front is the most efficient way how to ensure consistency. Therefore, we are going to have a session with managers before each performance review cycle to make sure everyone has the same understanding of the following:

- Impact expectations from each Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, Leading Expert) - especially for the `Expert` and `Leading Expert` levels, there needs to be clarity on the expected impact of relevant competencies.
- Each role has specific responsibilities, and fulfilling them well is a prerequisite for good performance in a given position. And also, people can demonstrate additional competencies that are required for advancement in their careers. We need to recognize these two categories and not reward behaviors where people just go after the next-level competencies without doing their current role well.
- Competencies, once achieved, are not guaranteed to be retained forever.
- What should be the manager's action if people are underperforming or overperforming.
- Make sure everyone is aware of additional resources - Examples of Competency Interpretations. 
- Training should also be an opportunity to discuss questions within a larger group to get more opinions.
