# Managers

Managers participate in the performance reviews just like anyone else, but on top of that, they also facilitate performance reviews for their direct reports. Here are some things to take into account during performance reviews as a manager:

- Before the performance reviews, make sure you participate in the performance review [training](training.md). There you can raise your questions or concerns, share your knowledge, share experiences with difficult conversations and learn from each other.
- Also, participate in the [calibration](calibration.md) sessions to gain a wider perspective on your team.
- In order to ensure consistency, we're doing performance reviews in a top-down manner. Therefore make sure you **first complete your own performance review** before doing performance reviews of your direct reports.
- Make sure you **schedule more than 1 hour**, at least 90 minutes with your manager for performance reviews. As part of the process, go over the managerial 360 report and discuss all insights and talking points that come out of the 360.
- Before a performance review meeting, collect and **familiarize yourself with the following information**:
  - Competency assessment of the person.
  - Results of 360s or other types of feedback on that person.
  - Insights about the person from their technical leader (e.g. their role within the guild, whether their seniority corresponds to responsibilities, involvement in code reviews).
  - Your personal notes about the person collected since the last cycle of performance review.
- In some cases, it makes sense to **involve other people** into performance review meetings:
  - If you are planning to hold a difficult conversation with your direct report, feel free to include your manager in the talk.
  - If you as a manager seek more underlying feedback regarding technical skills, include the relevant technical leader.
  - If you inherited a new report recently, include the previous manager in the performance conversation.
  - Before the performance review, consider gathering feedback from relevant peers of your direct report, as they usually have valuable insights.
- Throughout the process, note down difficulties or issues. After the [performance review meetings](../performance-review-meeting.md) are done, be sure to share your learnings during the [retrospective](retrospective.md).

## Second Level Managers

When you receive the competency scores of a given employee, update the tech-wide payroll sheet with the scores and bump the reviewed column to performance review date. In addition, **review the payroll sheet**, identify whether the employees deserve a salary increase (review the last raise date, their minimum and index) and validate the increase with the 1st level manager. Make sure the salaries are fair, and nobody is under the minimum. Good practice is to also review the personal goals of independent contributors and provide adjustment feedback to the team leads, if necessary.
