# Career Framework

**Warning: We are currently warking on a new career framework and information here might be outdated.**

Our career framework is built bottom-up, which means it starts with very specific low-level skills which you can acquire. Having those skills advances you in different [competencies](competencies.md) where you basically level-up when you acquire new skills. Those competencies and levels reached there determine your overall career [progress](progress.md) within your [career track](career-tracks/readme.md). The career track is quite specific already and together with the progress, it enables (but not guarantees) your [job grade](grades.md), job title, salary bounds, [compensation](compensation.md) and also responsibilities (job description).

In order to determine all of this and **ensure that everyone progresses forward**, we do [performance reviews](performance-reviews/readme.md) every year, but hold regular more lighweight conversations. During a performance review, your manager will hold a general career discussion with you, you will [assess your competencies](performance-reviews/competency-assessment.md) with the manager and talk about your successes, failures and opportunities for improvement. To make sure we dedicate enough attention continuously to your [personal goals](performance-catchups/personal-goals.md), there are also periodic [performance catchups](performance-catchups/readme.md) where your manager will check up on your goals and help you in any way possible to **achieve the goals**. If you complete some of your goals, this is the event where new goals will be established.
