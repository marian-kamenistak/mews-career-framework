# Progress

A competency consists of individual skills that are organized into multiple levels. There are many **skills**, for example "You test your work following relevant examples." That is a skill within the delivery competency on the beginner level. For each skill you should asses whether you posses the skill using the following scores:

- **0 - Nope** - Not at all, meaning that you don't possess the skill.
- **1 - Somewhat** - Having the skill somewhat, but not fully there yet or not showing that consistently.
- **2 - Yes** - Fully possessing the skill, being able to provide multiple examples demonstrating it consistently. Also the skill should be persistent, meaning that you should not stop practicing the skill when you achieve it.

## Levels

Each of the competencies has six levels of expertise, which can be summarized as follows:

- **0 - Starter** - At the beginning of the learning path, not demonstrating the competency yet.
- **1 - Beginner** - Possessing basics of the competency, still rather junior, lot of guidance is needed.
- **2 - Intermediate** - Progressing further within the competency, mid-level, guidance is required sometimes.
- **3 - Advanced** - Having more advanced skills, senior in the role, being able to guide others.
- **4 - Expert** - Being able to pass on the knowledge and have impact on other teams or departments.
- **5 - Leading Expert** - Proven impact within the company, advancing the industry forward, thought leader.

The competencies are rather aspirational, so to get to level 3 is already big achievement. Levels above it require you in many cases to have impact past the standard boundaries of the competency and to affect whole organization or industry. It might take quite some time to reach a new level, so do not get discouraged, if you are not advancing every six months. For the sake of completeness, in order to reach a level, these are the three conditions necessary:

1. You must reach the previous level (= you cannot skip levels).
2. There should be no skill on the level with score 0 (= you cannot have a skill gap).
3. Average score of skills on the level has to be greater than 1.7 (= you must fully demonstrate most of the skills).

## Progress Calculation

In order to determine your progress and how far you are in your career track, you take [levels](#levels) of each [competency](competencies.md) (number between 0 and 5) and apply weighted average on them. This way, you get to single number, again between 0 and 5, which represents your overall **career progress**. It can be interpreted as a measure of seniority, with 0 being a novice and 5 being a world-class thought leader.

The weights are different for each [career track](career-tracks/readme.md) and they capture the fact that different competencies have various importance in different tracks. For example delivery is important for individual contributor, very important for team lead, but not that important for a family lead who is on contrary focused more on leadership and communication.

### Example

As an example, let's consider a standard engineer career track, whose weights might look something like this (please note that this is just an example of how the weights might look like, specific weights are defined for each career track):

- **25%** 🚚 Delivery
- **30%** 📚 Domain Expertise
- **30%** 💡 Problem Solving
- **10%** 💬 Communication
- **5%** 🎖️ Leadership

Now, let's say the person has reached level 3 in delivery and domain expertise and level 2 in the rest of competencies. That means their overall career progress is **2.55** as per the following calculation:

`3 × 0.25 + 3 × 0.30 + 2 × 0.30 + 2 × 0.10 + 2 × 0.05 = 2.55`
