# Competencies

We're basing our competencies on [Etsy's competency model](https://etsy.github.io/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder/competencies.html) which is a set of engineering competencies and skills several other big companies collaborated on, e.g. including Spotify. What we like the most about the model is, that it is actually **very ambitious** and in order to get to the top level in some competencies, it really requires technical or other excellence and industry thought leadership. It is not a shame at all if your level would be beginner in most of the competencies, level advanced already represents rather senior people. Level expert or especially leading expert truly means an industry expert and there are not many of those. So we took Etsy's model and adjusted it to Mews needs, our culture and values.

It is supposed to be aspirational, so if you're not sure, put in lower score or level. The **goal is to get better**, the goal is not to check all the boxes. The competency model is designed primarily for engineers, but with a little bit of stretch and interpretation, it is usable for all divisions and roles within technical department. There are five following competencies.
